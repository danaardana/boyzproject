BROADCASTING SETUP FOR REAL-TIME NOTIFICATIONS
==============================================

Add these lines to .env file:

BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher

PUSHER_APP_ID=2003476
PUSHER_APP_KEY=826b21ec656c73be408d
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=2c3e417407e10ea3cd24
PUSHER_HOST=
PUSHER_PORT=443
PUSHER_SCHEME=https
PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=mt1

STEPS TO GET PUSHER KEYS:
1. Go to https://pusher.com/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new app
4. Copy the App ID, Key, and Secret
5. Add them to your .env file
6. Set cluster to your region (e.g., mt1, eu, ap2)

ALTERNATIVE - USE LOG DRIVER FOR TESTING:
If you don't want to set up Pusher right now, you can use:
BROADCAST_DRIVER=log

This will log the events instead of broadcasting them (for testing purposes).
